# Telecom-Churn-Regression-and-Classification

This is a telecom churn dataset, on which regression and classification algorithms are used. 

1. To predict monthly charges, Linear Regression is used.
2. To predict the churn, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest are used. Out of which Decision Tree is performing well. The independent variables are single in Logistic regression and Decision Tree Classifier, but there are two independent variables used in Random Forest Classifier.This is a telecom churn dataset, on which regression and classification algorithms are used. 1.
